-Cascading Style Sheets
- Inline Css
- *internal CSS*
    - width can be in % or px
    - stylying for getting a rule/feature applied as many times as that element is used in the page;
- external CSS
    - stylying for appliying a rule through a link referring to an external css file that contains the features to be applied;
- debugging css: Chrome --> more tools --> developer --> elements or console and check for the indication of bugs;
- order in css: internal css (element-style - local rule, rewrites other rules) - body-style - external css (body - global rule)
-syntax of CSS:
    selector {property (rule): value;}
    (who?)      (what?)         (how?)
    the rule change the look of any property assigned;
- good CSS practices: if many properties inside of the same brackets, better to put them in alphabetical order, as it's easier to debugg.
